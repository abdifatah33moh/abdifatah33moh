## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Abdifatah from Somalia, and I a big fan of technology. I started learning IT last year, and I now working on my CompTIA A+ certificate. I found my passion in networks and cybersecurity, and also working in a large data centers. I also learned some programming languages like Javascript and python, and also how to create web pages using html and css, and I learned the language behind the creation of relational databases, SQL.
I hope one day I can achieve my goals and be very professional in networks and cybersecurity.
